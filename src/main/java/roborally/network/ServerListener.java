/**
 * Testing out Kryonet as suggested by Siv in the announcement 03.02 as the libGDX, suggested import in pom.xml
 * didn't work out with copy and paste, likely something I'm not understanding.
 * Anyhow I copied and pasted the one from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.esotericsoftware/kryonet/2.22.0-RC1
 * Seems to be working
 *
 * Assume we'll need a listener that gets updates from clients
